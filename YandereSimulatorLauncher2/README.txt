====================================
    Yandere Simulator Launcher 2
====================================

Release Notes:
Version 2.8.0
 - (GitHub Issue #5): Allow TLS 1.2 (and added more fallbacks in case settings are changed again).
 - Updated Mega.nz from NuGet to support new URL format.
 - (GitHub Issue #2): Fixed launcher not reseting when an unknown exception is encountered on install.

Version 2.7.1
 - Initial public release

Known Issues:
 - Moving the window between monitors can make the video (temporarily) freeze and/or black-out.
     => The launcher uses Windows Media Video for file size and compatibility.

 - Some effects (ex: the video background) require Desktop Composition ("Aero") to be enabled.

 - Closing the launcher while it is unpacking can corrupt the unzip process.
     => The next time you open the launcher, the launcher should say "Install" or
        "Update available". That will attempt to fix (re-install) Yandere Simulator.
     => You can also download a new copy of the launcher from YandereDev's website.

====================================================


Preamble
----------

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Definitions
-------------

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

`"Original Version"` refers to the collection of Font Software components as
